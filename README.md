* Classes to create and Excel 2007 spreadsheet

This package contains classes to create an Excel 2007 (.xlsx) spreadsheet.
It is an alternative to Apache POI.  This class can create very large
spreadsheets.  I wrote it because Apachie POI took a very long time or ran out
of memory when converting a large database table to a spreadsheet.
